jsHtmlToText is a basic regex-based HTML stripper.

### How it works

1. It removes all linebreaks, script-tags, styles, comments and DOCTYPE.
2. Replaces most of block tags with double newlines or special replacers ( for example: 'li' replaced by '\n* ', to show points before list items ).
3. Replaces some of the block tags with a single newline or special replacers ( for example: 'li' replaced by '\n* ', to show points before list items ).
4. Replaces &lt;br&gt; with a single newline.
5. Removes all html-tags left after steps 1-4
6. Makes sure there are no more that two linebreaks in a row, removes linebreaks at the start and at the end of string, trims rightmost whitespaces and decodes html entities such as &nbsp;

### Extensions

You are able to change process of formatting by providing hooks in pre-processing, tag-replacing and post-processing. See tests/extensions.coffee for examples of hooks.

### History

It was created for a custom WebTV widget framework, which did not support other existing implementations.

Use it when:

* you need a minimal implementation
* don't have access to a proper JavaScript implementation (it was originally written for Konqueror)
* there no strong security requirements
